95,0,"The backstory claims Noirtier handed the conspiracy dossier to a British spy to engineer Villefort's murder, but Evidence 2 (74.55% relevance) shows Louis XVIII explicitly stating Villefort would 'sacrifice everything, even his father' for ambition, contradicting the premise of Noirtier needing to act pre-emptively. Evidence 3 (69.17% relevance) confirms Villefort actively avoided his father, making Noirtier's alleged access implausible. Evidence 6 (66.49% relevance) identifies the dossier as Danglars' letter denouncing Dantès—not originating from Noirtier—and acquired via judicial files, not British spies. These contradictions violate causal logic and narrative constraints.",success,30.670964241027832,3,9
136,0,"The backstory claims continuous island residence from 1800 onward while drafting intellectual work, but Evidence 5 explicitly states the island was uninhabited ('I said there were no fixed habitations') and used only intermittently by smugglers/pirates. Evidence 3's discussion of intellectual compression occurs in a prison context, not peaceful island drafting. Evidence 7-9 show secret messages but no evidence of chapter transmissions, creating narrative inconsistency with the claimed quiet drafting life. The moderate relevance scores (average distance 0.44) further weaken any potential alignment.",success,16.014710426330566,3,9
59,0,"The backstory claims avalanche-reading skills and posing as a relay-station hand, but no evidence supports these elements. Evidence 1, 2, and 3 (67.71%-62% relevance) describe escapes using rope-biting and climbing (Evidence 1: 'biting asunder his ropes', Evidence 3: 'rope... helped me to climb'), but show survival through hiding/foraging (Evidence 2: 'living on roots') - not avalanches. The relay-station disguise is absent in all evidence. Evidence 4-9 (59.6%-58.4% relevance) are either irrelevant or from different novels, failing to support these specific claims.",success,12.619161605834961,3,9
60,0,"The backstory claims Thalcave rescued eight survivors from an 1852 avalanche involving a silver-prospecting caravan, but evidence contradicts this. First, Evidence 5/8/9 describe an avalanche event with only seven main characters (not eight) and no caravan (Evidence 4/7 show carts used by the protagonists, not prospectors). Second, Evidence 8 explicitly states Robert Grant was missing after the avalanche, contradicting the rescue claim. Third, Evidence 7 references gold prospecting in 1851-1852, not silver, and no character named Roux appears in any evidence (Paganel is the French geographer present). Finally, Thalcave's actions in Evidence 1-3/10-11 show him assisting protagonists against wolves/river currents, not leading avalanche rescues.",success,11.915532350540161,4,11
124,0,"The backstory claims Edmond witnessed Caderousse stealing a mooring rope on the Marseille quay but remained silent. However, Evidence 1 and Evidence 3 establish Edmond's presence at the Marseille quay with detailed descriptions of his interactions, yet make no mention of Caderousse or theft (Relevance: 70.87%, 68.39%). Evidence 8 explicitly describes Caderousse as an 'intimate friend' of Edmond without referencing any witnessed theft (Relevance: 64.06%). Crucially, Evidence 6 shows Caderousse defending Edmond's innocence ('he has neither robbed, nor killed'), which directly contradicts the backstory's implication of Caderousse's early criminal behavior witnessed by Edmond. The absence of supporting evidence combined with this contradiction renders the backstory inconsistent.",success,17.3979389667511,3,8
111,0,"The backstory describes an aging character covertly encouraging anti-royalist activities through old connections, but Evidence 7 explicitly contradicts this by showing Noirtier's political capabilities were completely destroyed by a stroke ('a rupture of a blood-vessel destroyed all this... in a second'). Evidence 8-9 further undermine the claim by revealing Villefort actively suppressed anti-royalist conspiracies during Napoleon's return, while Evidence 3 shows royalist officials like Villefort warning about usurper threats, creating logical inconsistencies with the described anti-royalist encouragement.",success,14.148463249206543,3,9
135,0,"The backstory claims imprisonment starting in 1796 with escape in 1800, but Evidence 3 and 4 establish Abbé Faria's imprisonment began in 1811 (not 1796) and Dantès' in 1815. Evidence 1 further confirms Dantès was still imprisoned in 1816. The claimed Roman prison location contradicts Evidence 2 and 3 showing French/Italian prisons (Fenestrelle, Château d'If, Saint-Mandrier). While Evidence 5-7 support treatise-writing activities, the timeline and location contradictions create irreconcilable inconsistencies.",success,12.542143821716309,3,7
27,0,"The backstory claims permanent hearing loss from a childhood beating (Evidence 3 shows adult hearing is functional with conversational exchanges). Evidence 5-6 and 8 depict Dantès hearing shouts, chains, and conversations without impairment, directly contradicting the disability claim. No evidence supports the dock-worker origin or beating incident, with all high-relevance excerpts (57.52%-55.81%) describing unrelated adult scenarios.",success,17.08779788017273,3,9
110,0,"The evidence contradicts the backstory. Villefort's locked study contains official legal documents (Evidence 2: 'heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else') and case materials, not revolutionary pamphlets. His solitary reflections focus on recent criminal cases (Evidence 2: 'ponder over the events... during the last eight days') rather than personal letters or revolutionary materials. The highest-relevance evidence (68.34%-65.92%) shows locked rooms serving purposes like privacy for emotional breakdowns (Evidence 3) or confidential legal work, not re-reading revolutionary materials. Evidence 9 confirms politically sensitive documents exist but are associated with Noirtier, not stored in Villefort's study.",success,32.85175895690918,3,9
42,0,"The backstory claims Fletcher served as first mate on the Britannia and warned about the character's 'unstable record' (Evidence 1-3). However, novel evidence explicitly identifies Tom Ayrton as quartermaster under Captain Grant with verified credentials and no mention of Fletcher (Evidence 1: 'Tom Ayrton, able seaman... quartermaster'). The narrative shows Ayrton being trusted ('worthy of your entire confidence' - Evidence 1), contradicting the alleged warnings. Furthermore, Evidence 3 details Ayrton's direct account of the voyage without referencing any instability concerns, creating logical inconsistency with the backstory's premise.",success,20.731881618499756,4,11
56,0,"The evidence contradicts the backstory on multiple points. First, earthquake occurrences are consistently sudden (Evidence 2, 4, 9 show no prior prediction, only reactive identification). Second, saving actions are attributed to Thalcave (Evidence 5) without payment refusal or spiritual attribution. Third, declining credit (Evidence 6) occurs in unrelated contexts without 'spirit of the plains' reference. The backstory's causal chain (prediction → salvation → declined payment) lacks evidentiary support.",success,15.116479635238647,4,10
80,0,"The backstory contradicts novel evidence in key aspects: Evidence 3 shows Vampa hunting with firearms in mountains (not jungle tracking/spear-craft) and killing solitary wolves (not boar groups). Evidence 7 and 12 depict fathers as military/caring figures without tribal elements or pirate deaths. Evidence 6 and 8 describe warrior traditions but lack 'Junior Champion' titles or father-to-son training. The pirate raid, paramount chief appointment, and boar-hunting feat find no support in any evidence chunk.",success,16.271206855773926,5,14
28,0,"The backstory claims Ayrton was coerced into false testimony about insurance fraud on the Emerald Bird, but evidence shows Ayrton consistently identifies as Captain Grant's quartermaster from the Britannia (Evidence 6) and negotiates truth-telling about that shipwreck (Evidence 8-9). No evidence mentions the Emerald Bird, insurance fraud, or forced testimony, creating direct contradictions with the backstory's core claims. The highest-relevance evidence (68.72%-62.88%) establishes Ayrton's identity and narrative around the Britannia, not the alleged events in the backstory.",success,13.473773002624512,4,12
101,0,"The backstory claims the character joined a radical republican cell at 18, but evidence directly contradicts this for the only characters with explicit age information. Edmond Dantès was imprisoned at 19 as an innocent sailor (Evidence 6: 'I was just nineteen when I was arrested'), with Caderousse defending his non-involvement in crimes (Evidence 3: 'he has neither robbed, nor killed, nor murdered'). Benedetto's criminal history begins as a forger/thief (Evidence 7: 'First I was a forger...'), not radical politics. While Noirtier was a Jacobin (Evidence 5), his age of joining is never specified, making the backstory inconsistent with documented character histories.",success,17.228378295898438,3,7
91,0,"The backstory claims the character worked for Fouché to assassinate royalists while posing as a justice official, but Evidence 1, 3, and 7 show Villefort (a justice official) reporting Bonapartist conspiracies to King Louis XVIII and reacting with terror to royalist investigations (distance 0.350-0.372). Evidence 6 explicitly identifies Villefort as suppressing Bonapartists (distance 0.411), directly contradicting the backstory's premise. The arsenic phial is unsupported, as Evidence 9 and 11 describe generic poisoning methods and buried boxes (distance 0.430-0.441), not hidden desk drawers.",success,13.036367177963257,4,12
24,0,"The backstory claims the character was recommended for Captain Grant's ship 'Brittany,' but Evidence 3 explicitly identifies Grant's vessel as the 'Britannia' of Glasgow. Evidence 1-3 consistently reference Grant's ship as Britannia (not Brittany), creating a direct naming contradiction. No evidence supports the South-American trade route proposal or London transfer, and the highest-relevance evidence (62.4%) contradicts the ship's name, making the backstory logically inconsistent with established facts.",success,15.626816272735596,3,9
119,0,"The backstory claims initial confinement at Fenestrella Fortress contradicts Evidence 1-3 showing Dantès' imprisonment begins at Château d'If (e.g., 'he was in prison' in Evidence 2 with specific March 1st timeline). The essay-scratching detail lacks support: Evidence 8 describes nail-writing but concerns shepherd Luigi's education, unrelated to Dantès or Mediterranean themes. Evidence 4's rock markings refer to treasure clues, not essays. Plagiarism claims are entirely unsupported. High-relevance evidence (63.62%-60.76%) establishes Château d'If as the primary prison, creating a logical impossibility for Fenestrella confinement.",success,11.95658278465271,3,9
93,0,"The evidence directly contradicts the backstory's claim of hidden letters in oak barrels. Evidence 3 shows Villefort intercepting a single letter from Elba addressed to Noirtier (not multiple copies), which he uses for personal gain ('from this letter... I will make my fortune'). Evidence 6 reveals Noirtier's papers were concealed in a secret drawer in his desk, not barrels in a vineyard. The high-relevance Evidence 1-3 (72.4%-68.74%) consistently depict immediate letter interception without any vineyard discovery, creating logical impossibility for the barrel-hiding narrative.",success,11.633345603942871,4,12
72,0,"The backstory claims spies were sent to Auckland to watch Glenarvan, but Evidence 5 and 10 explicitly show Glenarvan's group arriving in New Zealand without encountering any pre-placed spies (relevance 53.25% and 48.55%). Evidence 6 describes Glenarvan being captured by Maoris upon arrival (relevance 51.11%), contradicting the notion of covert surveillance by trained servants. No evidence mentions spies, trained youths, or secret watchers in Auckland, creating logical impossibilities in the narrative timeline and causality.",success,15.0780611038208,4,10
16,0,"The backstory claims British merchant family in Calcutta with East India Company ties and French nurse mother, but Evidence 9 (distance 0.521) directly contradicts this by stating the character was 'taken away by the treachery of my tutor' at age five with no mention of Calcutta or merchant background, instead describing an aristocratic father ('income amounts to half a million'). Evidence 7 mentions Calcutta but is from a different book (In Search of the Castaways) and describes a traveler's mission, not family origins.

Evidence 4-6 (60% relevance) describes prison conditions and escape attempts but contains no references to poison experimentation on prisoners. This creates a direct contradiction: the novel attributes medical expertise to Dr. d'Avrigny, not the Count, and provides no support for prisoner experimentation as claimed in the backstory.",success,13.008880376815796,3,7

Evidence 9 references a native student learning geography from missionaries, but no language instruction aligns with the backstory.

High-relevance evidence (1, 2, 3) shows the father was killed in a political assassination by Palikares/Turks (not colonists) after refusing a death order, not migration routes. Evidence 3 explicitly describes the son (narrator) falling unconscious during the attack rather than fleeing, with no mention of silver horse-gear.

86,0,"Evidence directly contradicts the backstory's claims. Evidence 6 shows Ayrton/Ben Joyce as unresponsive and defiant during interrogation ('deaf to every question', 'remained unmoved'), contradicting 'valued life and kept his word'. Evidence 13 further undermines trust-building by depicting coerced oaths ('swear by my honor... plead guilty of death'), making 'fragile trust' illogical. High-relevance Evidence 1-3 (68% relevance) shows Glenarvan's leadership but no supportive character dynamics.",success,12.507669925689697,5.0,14.0
38,0,"The evidence contradicts the backstory's key elements. First, the storm scenes (Evidence 1,2,3,5,6) show characters prioritizing safety without military context or reprimands for rescue attempts. Second, the military-related evidence (Evidence 4,7,8) depicts coercion and oaths (high relevance 60.06%-54.33%) but no storm-convoy scenario or disciplinary actions matching the described event. Third, the closest rescue attempt (Evidence 3) occurs in a civilian context without military order disruptions. The absence of evidence for 'convoy run' or 'reprimand for saving people' creates logical inconsistencies with the backstory's causal claims.",success,15.453252792358398,3.0,8.0
132,0,"The evidence contradicts the backstory's claims about academic achievements at Rome University by age 18. Evidence 3 shows Abbé Faria acquired languages through self-study in prison, not formal education ('by the aid of ancient Greek I learned modern Greek'). Evidence 4 and 6 confirm Faria's scholarly work was developed during imprisonment ('meditated over in the shades of the Colosseum... arranged within the walls of the Château d'If'), with no mention of university attendance. Evidence 9 references adult scholarly activities in Rome but explicitly occurs when Faria was preparing to leave Rome as an established scholar, not as an 18-year-old student. The high-relevance language evidence (1-3) demonstrates learning occurred post-imprisonment, not during youth.",success,22.369017362594604,3.0,9.0
77,0,"The backstory claims rescue by biologist Wallace and a bird-of-paradise book linking to Glenarvan, but evidence shows Robert Grant was rescued by Glenarvan's party (Evidence 2,4) with no Wallace involvement. Key elements like the picture book, Wallace, or naturalist connections are absent across all excerpts (Evidence 1-7), including high-relevance character interactions (Evidence 3,5). The rescue causality contradicts Evidence 4 where Robert actively saves Glenarvan, not vice-versa.",success,10.449517726898193,3.0,7.0
70,0,"The backstory describes earning chieftainship through a crater survival trial and executing a wife named Julia for espionage, but no evidence supports these events. Evidence 4 shows leadership gained through killing a chief (Cucumetto), not survival. Evidence 6 and 9 depict killings with knives, but for honor/revenge (Rita) or execution rituals, not spousal execution for missionary espionage. Evidence 14 shows tribal conflict over a woman (Lady Helena), but no Julia or marriage ban. High-relevance evidence (1, 4, 6, 14) contradicts the backstory's causal chain and narrative elements.",success,17.348461627960205,5.0,14.0
115,0,"The backstory claims Jesuit novitiate and secret study of Charaka Samhita in Goa, but Evidence 1 explicitly states the character is Lutheran ('I believe he is a Lutheran') contradicting Jesuit affiliation. Evidence 9 discusses toxicology expertise originating from botanical/mineralogical studies in the East, not Indian medical texts, while Evidence 8 shows his Oriental knowledge was acquired later in life ('when I have completed my affairs in Paris'). The religious contradiction and mismatched origin of toxicology expertise create logical impossibilities.",success,9.935647964477539,3.0,9.0
78,0,"The backstory describes tribal island dynamics with a mother's assassination and clan execution, but the evidence contradicts this setting and events. Evidence 3 and 5 depict Mediterranean/Ottoman contexts (Greek viziers, Italian bandits), not Pacific tribal societies. Evidence 7 and 11 reference Maori chiefs but lack maternal assassination or clan executions. Crucially, Evidence 3 shows a father's death (not mother's), Evidence 5 describes a daughter's murder (not alliance princess), and no evidence supports the 'flesh stripped from bone' execution method. The highest-relevance evidence (1-2) discusses European aristocracy, further contradicting the tribal premise.",success,15.139940738677979,4.0,11.0
87,0,"The backstory claims Villefort's father was guillotined in 1792, but Evidence 1 (66.14% relevance) explicitly shows Villefort stating his father survived the Reign of Terror ('had well-nigh lost his head'). Evidence 4 (61.18% relevance) further confirms Noirtier (Villefort's father) was politically active post-1792 as a Jacobin revolutionary. This directly contradicts the execution claim. Additionally, no evidence supports the described hand tremors or trauma-induced revulsion, making the causal relationships unsupported.",success,11.019576072692871,3.0,7.0
75,0,"The backstory claims the character determines shipwreck locations via tidal changes (Evidence 7,8,9 show Captain Mangles handling navigation/tides, not the character) and views eruptions as divine punishment against colonizers (Evidence 2,4,5 attribute this belief to natives, not the character; Evidence 5 shows Paganel merely predicts native reactions without sharing their beliefs). Geographical expertise is confirmed (Evidence 1,3,6) but the specific claims about tidal analysis and personal divine punishment views lack support and contradict textual evidence.",success,13.696999788284302,3.0,9.0
44,0,"The backstory describes diary confessions of self-loathing and relief about an unknown betrayal, but Evidence 3 explicitly shows a character denying journal-keeping ('I wish to forget it myself') and Villefort reacting with distress rather than relief. While Evidence 1 and 5 demonstrate remorse for betrayal (Villefort's 'unending torture' over sacrificing an innocent), they lack any reference to diary-writing or pride, and Evidence 2 depicts writing on stamped paper (likely legal documents) without confessional content. The critical diary element of the backstory is contradicted by the novel's evidence, creating a logical inconsistency in the narrative mechanism for confession.",success,12.853395938873291,3.0,9.0

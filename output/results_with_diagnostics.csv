While evidence mentions characters like Haydée (Evidence 1,2,6,11) and Robert Grant (Evidence 13,17) experiencing enslavement or family separation, none explicitly reference a sister named 'Nawee' or directly refute the described oath. The backstory introduces new details (name, oath) not addressed in the evidence, and no passages explicitly deny such an event or motivation. Per analysis rules, without direct contradictory evidence ('Slave-raiders did NOT seize Nawee' or 'He never swore such an oath'), consistency is maintained.",success,104.34671473503113,5.0,30.0
86,1,"The backstory describes Glenarvan's initial perception of a man (contextually Ayrton) as 'haughty and cold' yet notes he 'valued life and kept his word,' with 'fragile trust' developing during a stand-off. Evidence 9 (Relevance 64.49%) shows Ayrton as initially unresponsive ('remained unmoved...deaf to every question'), aligning with 'haughty and cold.' Evidence 15 (Relevance 61.78%) demonstrates Ayrton bargaining for his life and offering accountability ('if I deceive you...you will always have the power to revenge yourself'), supporting 'valued life and kept his word.' Evidence 9 also depicts Glenarvan's patient, calm approach ('imposing...calmness upon violent agitation'), suggesting developing trust. No evidence explicitly contradicts these claims; moderate-strength passages support or neutrally align with the backstory without logical impossibilities or narrative breaks.",success,22.457163333892822,5.0,32.0
38,1,"Evidence 6 explicitly shows Edmond Dantès exhibiting a quick temper ('his anger waxed hot') when perceiving injustice, supporting the first claim. No evidence contradicts the backstory's core elements: 1) The storm/saving incident isn't mentioned in any passage, leaving it unaddressed. 2) Evidence 6 aligns with the characterization of a temper. 3) No passages describe military discipline scenarios that would conflict with the backstory. Weak/moderate evidence strength prevents assuming contradiction for unmentioned events. Default to consistent when no explicit refutation exists.",success,14.001893997192383,5.0,29.0
132,1,"No explicit contradictions found in the evidence. The backstory claims fluency in languages and academic achievements by age 18, but the evidence: (1) Shows characters learning languages (Dantès, abbé) without specifying ages, (2) Mentions academic work (Faria's treatise) without age context, (3) References Rome University only indirectly via locations. While the evidence doesn't confirm the backstory, it contains no statements like 'he never studied in Rome' or 'he wasn't fluent by 18' that would directly contradict the claims. Weak/moderate evidence cannot establish contradiction per analysis rules.",success,17.44039011001587,5.0,26.0
77,1,"No explicit contradictions found in the evidence. The backstory involves Wallace and a bird-of-paradise picture book, which are not mentioned in any provided passages. Evidence describes bird sightings (e.g., tanagers, flamingoes) but none conflict with the existence of such a book. Glenarvan's rescues of Robert Grant (Evidence 7, 15, 17) occur in different contexts and don't preclude an unrelated rescue by Wallace. The novel's silence on these details doesn't constitute contradiction; absence isn't refutation. Claims remain logically possible within the narrative framework.",success,16.87705659866333,5.0,32.0
70,1,"The evidence does not explicitly contradict the backstory. While the evidence contains tribal contexts (Maori chiefs, taboo traditions) and references to executions (Kara-Tété's death), it does not address the specific claims about earning chieftainship at 22 through a sulfur-stone trial, marrying/executing a 'white princess Julia,' or banning white marriages. The absence of these details does not constitute contradiction, and the tribal setting remains logically compatible with the backstory. Weak evidence strength (MODERATE) and lack of explicit refutation support consistency.",success,16.978217840194702,5.0,33.0
115,0,"Evidence 1 explicitly states the character is Lutheran, directly contradicting the Jesuit claim. The novel attributes toxicology expertise to Eastern experiences and self-study (e.g., brucine/Mithridates), not Charaka Samhita or Indian academia.",success,20.33009696006775,5.0,31.0
78,0,"The backstory claims the child witnessed his mother's assassination at age five. However, Evidence 5 explicitly states: 'I was but four years old when one night I was suddenly awakened by my mother' during the attack. Evidence 11 corroborates this age: 'I was four years old; but as those events deeply concerned me, not a single detail has escaped my memory.' This constitutes a direct factual contradiction in timeline (Claim 3). Additionally, the novel's setting (Yanina, Greece) contradicts the 'island' description, and no evidence supports the clan execution or flesh-stripping details (Claims 4-5).",success,19.491309881210327,5.0,30.0
87,0,"Evidence 2 explicitly contradicts the backstory: Villefort states his father (Noirtier) 'was an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had well-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished.' This confirms Noirtier survived execution during the Reign of Terror (1793-1794), directly conflicting with the backstory's claim of guillotining in 1792. Additionally, Evidence 12 reinforces this by showing Noirtier later became a senator under Napoleon, which would be impossible if executed in 1792.",success,15.016806840896606,5.0,33.0
75,0,"The backstory claim that the character 'viewed volcanic eruptions as divine punishment against colonizers' is contradicted by Evidence 9. In this passage, Paganel explicitly proposes creating an artificial eruption as a strategic deception ('we are to feign being consumed by the flames of Pluto'), framing it as exploiting native beliefs ('the avenging flames are under our feet') rather than endorsing divine punishment. This demonstrates a scientific/rational view of volcanic phenomena as natural forces to be manipulated, directly conflicting with the backstory's claimed belief in divine retribution.",success,18.690147399902344,5.0,35.0
44,1,"The evidence does not explicitly contradict the backstory's claims of solitude-induced remorse, self-loathing for betrayal, or diary confessions. Key supporting evidence includes: Villefort's solitary remorse in Evidence 1 ('remorse is not thus banished... carried the arrow in his wound'), self-loathing for betrayal in Evidence 2 ('the man he sacrificed to his ambition... appeared pale and threatening'), and Evidence 22 showing secret record-keeping ('parcel of cherished memoranda... names arranged in characters only known to himself'). While no diary is explicitly mentioned, the memoranda serve a similar confessional purpose without contradiction. No evidence explicitly denies these behaviors or introduces logical impossibilities. Weak/moderate evidence strength precludes definitive contradiction.",success,16.612842321395874,5.0,27.0

Additionally, Evidence 2 shows Monte Cristo discussing brucine with Madame de Villefort without referencing any experimental background, while Evidence 12 further demonstrates his theoretical knowledge comes from Eastern chemistry traditions ('To be a great chemist in the East...').

While no evidence directly mentions spying motives, the colonization schemes' existence is validated, and the absence of explicit contradiction about crew motivations makes this backstory plausible. No evidence explicitly denies spying or conflicts with this motive, satisfying consistency criteria.",success,13.869616270065308,5.0,30.0,,
15,1.0,"No explicit contradiction found in the evidence. The backstory describes a character skill developed in the Amazon, but the provided evidence focuses on Patagonian and Maori encounters without addressing Amazon experiences or bone ornament analysis. Evidence 2, 19, and 22 describe tribal ornaments (jade earrings, necklaces, tattoos) but don't contradict the claimed method of gauging civilization through bone ornaments. Absence of Amazon references doesn't disprove the backstory, as the novel's current events occur elsewhere. Weak evidence strength (50-59% relevance) further supports consistency by failing to provide definitive counter-evidence.",success,15.464421510696411,5.0,25.0,,
82,1.0,"No explicit contradictions found in the evidence. The backstory describes unique events (gnawing fish-bones, inspiring captives with bone ash, stealing dictionary pages) not addressed in the provided passages. While Evidence 2 shows Dantès learning languages systematically from an abbé, this doesn't contradict the backstory's claim of piecing together words from stolen pages, as they could occur at different times or contexts. The evidence strength is moderate, and absence of mention doesn't equal contradiction. No evidence explicitly denies the possibility of these events occurring for this character.",success,25.485321521759033,5.0,25.0,,
37,1.0,"No explicit contradictions found in the evidence. The backstory describes Ayrton's childhood (birthplace, family, early nautical studies) which is never addressed in the novel passages. Evidence focuses on his adult actions as quartermaster (mutiny, deception, imprisonment) but contains no information about his origins or family relationships. While Ayrton is revealed as Ben Joyce (Evidence 13), this criminal identity doesn't inherently contradict having a brother named Benjamin or a naval father. Absence of confirmation ≠ contradiction, and the novel's silence on these pre-story details maintains consistency.",success,18.32427978515625,5.0,16.0,,

95,0,"The backstory claims Noirtier handed the conspiracy dossier to a British spy to engineer Villefort's murder, but Evidence 2 (74.55% relevance) shows Louis XVIII explicitly stating Villefort would 'sacrifice everything, even his father' for ambition, contradicting the premise of Noirtier needing to act pre-emptively. Evidence 3 (69.17% relevance) confirms Villefort actively avoided his father, making Noirtier's alleged access implausible. Evidence 6 (66.49% relevance) identifies the dossier as Danglars' letter denouncing Dantès—not originating from Noirtier—and acquired via judicial files, not British spies. These contradictions violate causal logic and narrative constraints.",success,30.670964241027832,3,9
136,0,"The backstory claims continuous island residence from 1800 onward while drafting intellectual work, but Evidence 5 explicitly states the island was uninhabited ('I said there were no fixed habitations') and used only intermittently by smugglers/pirates. Evidence 3's discussion of intellectual compression occurs in a prison context, not peaceful island drafting. Evidence 7-9 show secret messages but no evidence of chapter transmissions, creating narrative inconsistency with the claimed quiet drafting life. The moderate relevance scores (average distance 0.44) further weaken any potential alignment.",success,16.014710426330566,3,9
59,0,"The backstory claims avalanche-reading skills and posing as a relay-station hand, but no evidence supports these elements. Evidence 1, 2, and 3 (67.71%-62% relevance) describe escapes using rope-biting and climbing (Evidence 1: 'biting asunder his ropes', Evidence 3: 'rope... helped me to climb'), but show survival through hiding/foraging (Evidence 2: 'living on roots') - not avalanches. The relay-station disguise is absent in all evidence. Evidence 4-9 (59.6%-58.4% relevance) are either irrelevant or from different novels, failing to support these specific claims.",success,12.619161605834961,3,9
60,0,"The backstory claims Thalcave rescued eight survivors from an 1852 avalanche involving a silver-prospecting caravan, but evidence contradicts this. First, Evidence 5/8/9 describe an avalanche event with only seven main characters (not eight) and no caravan (Evidence 4/7 show carts used by the protagonists, not prospectors). Second, Evidence 8 explicitly states Robert Grant was missing after the avalanche, contradicting the rescue claim. Third, Evidence 7 references gold prospecting in 1851-1852, not silver, and no character named Roux appears in any evidence (Paganel is the French geographer present). Finally, Thalcave's actions in Evidence 1-3/10-11 show him assisting protagonists against wolves/river currents, not leading avalanche rescues.",success,11.915532350540161,4,11
124,0,"The backstory claims Edmond witnessed Caderousse stealing a mooring rope on the Marseille quay but remained silent. However, Evidence 1 and Evidence 3 establish Edmond's presence at the Marseille quay with detailed descriptions of his interactions, yet make no mention of Caderousse or theft (Relevance: 70.87%, 68.39%). Evidence 8 explicitly describes Caderousse as an 'intimate friend' of Edmond without referencing any witnessed theft (Relevance: 64.06%). Crucially, Evidence 6 shows Caderousse defending Edmond's innocence ('he has neither robbed, nor killed'), which directly contradicts the backstory's implication of Caderousse's early criminal behavior witnessed by Edmond. The absence of supporting evidence combined with this contradiction renders the backstory inconsistent.",success,17.3979389667511,3,8
111,0,"The backstory describes an aging character covertly encouraging anti-royalist activities through old connections, but Evidence 7 explicitly contradicts this by showing Noirtier's political capabilities were completely destroyed by a stroke ('a rupture of a blood-vessel destroyed all this... in a second'). Evidence 8-9 further undermine the claim by revealing Villefort actively suppressed anti-royalist conspiracies during Napoleon's return, while Evidence 3 shows royalist officials like Villefort warning about usurper threats, creating logical inconsistencies with the described anti-royalist encouragement.",success,14.148463249206543,3,9
135,0,"The backstory claims imprisonment starting in 1796 with escape in 1800, but Evidence 3 and 4 establish Abbé Faria's imprisonment began in 1811 (not 1796) and Dantès' in 1815. Evidence 1 further confirms Dantès was still imprisoned in 1816. The claimed Roman prison location contradicts Evidence 2 and 3 showing French/Italian prisons (Fenestrelle, Château d'If, Saint-Mandrier). While Evidence 5-7 support treatise-writing activities, the timeline and location contradictions create irreconcilable inconsistencies.",success,12.542143821716309,3,7
27,0,"The backstory claims permanent hearing loss from a childhood beating (Evidence 3 shows adult hearing is functional with conversational exchanges). Evidence 5-6 and 8 depict Dantès hearing shouts, chains, and conversations without impairment, directly contradicting the disability claim. No evidence supports the dock-worker origin or beating incident, with all high-relevance excerpts (57.52%-55.81%) describing unrelated adult scenarios.",success,17.08779788017273,3,9
110,0,"The evidence contradicts the backstory. Villefort's locked study contains official legal documents (Evidence 2: 'heap of papers calculated to alarm anyone else') and case materials, not revolutionary pamphlets. His solitary reflections focus on recent criminal cases (Evidence 2: 'ponder over the events... during the last eight days') rather than personal letters or revolutionary materials. The highest-relevance evidence (68.34%-65.92%) shows locked rooms serving purposes like privacy for emotional breakdowns (Evidence 3) or confidential legal work, not re-reading revolutionary materials. Evidence 9 confirms politically sensitive documents exist but are associated with Noirtier, not stored in Villefort's study.",success,32.85175895690918,3,9
42,0,"The backstory claims Fletcher served as first mate on the Britannia and warned about the character's 'unstable record' (Evidence 1-3). However, novel evidence explicitly identifies Tom Ayrton as quartermaster under Captain Grant with verified credentials and no mention of Fletcher (Evidence 1: 'Tom Ayrton, able seaman... quartermaster'). The narrative shows Ayrton being trusted ('worthy of your entire confidence' - Evidence 1), contradicting the alleged warnings. Furthermore, Evidence 3 details Ayrton's direct account of the voyage without referencing any instability concerns, creating logical inconsistency with the backstory's premise.",success,20.731881618499756,4,11

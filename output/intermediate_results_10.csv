95,0,"Evidence 24 explicitly contradicts the backstory's claim that Villefort intended to denounce Noirtier. The passage states: 'Why, you poor short-sighted simpleton, can you not guess who this Noirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed? This Noirtier was his father!' followed by Villefort destroying the incriminating letter to protect Noirtier. This directly opposes the backstory's assertion of Villefort's intent to denounce his father, making the backstory impossible within the novel's established narrative.",success,26.07528066635132,5,25
136,0,"Evidence 8 (The Count of Monte Cristo) explicitly contradicts the backstory: Abbé Faria states 'I have been imprisoned since 1811' and describes drafting his treatise while incarcerated at Château d'If ('I wrote or studied... I had none but what I made for myself'). This directly conflicts with the backstory's claim of island residence from 1800 onward. Evidence 11 further confirms Faria created his work in prison using makeshift materials, with no mention of couriers or island setting.",success,105.97614812850952,5,28
59,1,"The evidence supports key elements of the backstory without explicit contradictions: 1) Multiple passages (Evidence 2, 10, 12, 15) confirm escapes from captivity and returns to mountainous terrain. 2) Rope-climbing survival skills are explicitly demonstrated (Evidence 1, 3, 5, 12, 18). 3) Avalanche awareness is contextually plausible (Evidence 16, 24, 27 describe avalanche events, though no 'reading' skill is directly shown). While the 'relay-station hand' detail isn't explicitly verified, its absence doesn't contradict the narrative. No evidence explicitly denies any claim, and moderate-strength passages align with the escape/survival framework.",success,15.433967113494873,5,27
60,1,"No explicit contradictory evidence found in the provided passages. The novel contains multiple avalanche events (Evidence 1, 4, 10, 14, 19, 21, 22) and depicts Thalcave as a heroic rescuer (Evidence 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 23), but none directly conflict with the specific 1852 silver-prospecting caravan rescue described in the backstory. While the French geographer in the novel is Paganel (Evidence 12, 16, 17), not Roux, this does not inherently contradict the existence of another geographer. The evidence strength is moderate but lacks explicit denial of the backstory's claims.",success,15.973235845565796,5,29
124,1,"No explicit contradiction found in the evidence. The backstory describes young Caderousse stealing a mooring rope in Marseille—a plausible act given his established character as dishonest (e.g., Evidence 30 shows him involved in shady dealings). While the specific event isn't directly supported, Evidence 1 and 4 reference Marseille quays and theft-related contexts without conflicting. Weak/irrelevant evidence (e.g., 'In Search of Castaways' excerpts) cannot contradict. Absence of explicit denial or timeline/logic conflict means the backstory remains consistent.",success,14.562088251113892,5,30
111,1,"The backstory describes a physically weakened character leveraging old connections to influence anti-royalist activities. Evidence 14-17 explicitly references Noirtier de Villefort—a paralyzed former Jacobin revolutionary—who maintains political influence through mental acuity and proxies. Evidence 14 states he 'condescends only to regard the young shoot' (influencing successors), Evidence 16 shows his nonverbal communication of continued capability ('I can still do much for you'), and Evidence 17 confirms his history as 'one of the most fiery Jacobins.' No evidence contradicts this portrayal; instead, the novel consistently depicts him orchestrating events despite physical limitations. Weak evidence thresholds don't apply here as moderate-strength passages directly support the claim.",success,12.611495971679688,5,31
135,1,"No explicit contradictions found in the evidence. The backstory describes events (1796-1800) not directly addressed in the provided novel excerpts. While evidence discusses later imprisonments (e.g., Abbé Faria's confinement from 1811 onward), it doesn't conflict with the claimed 1796 imprisonment. The evidence confirms prison writing occurs (e.g., Evidence 4,6,7) and escapes happen (e.g., Evidence 14,24), supporting the backstory's plausibility. Absence of evidence ≠ contradiction per analysis rules.",success,19.7390296459198,5,32
27,1,"No explicit contradictions found in the evidence. The backstory describes childhood events (running away at 12, dock work, hearing loss from a beating over charts) that are not addressed in any provided passages. Evidence snippets focus on adult characters' sea voyages, discoveries, and dialogues without mentioning childhood occupations, hearing impairments, or chart-related incidents. While evidence strength is moderate, it lacks relevance to the specific claims in the backstory. Absence of contradictory details supports consistency.",success,105.37894177436829,5,35
110,1,Evidence 2 and Evidence 7 explicitly show Villefort secluding himself in a locked study ('door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed') while reflecting on past events ('began to ponder over the events... filled his mind with gloomy thoughts'). Evidence 16 further supports the presence of sensitive documents (the fatal Elba letter) in his possession. No evidence contradicts the claim of revolutionary pamphlets or private letters; the moderate-strength evidence aligns with the backstory's core elements without conflict.,success,99.57071948051453,5,32
42,1,"The evidence confirms Ayrton served as quartermaster on the Britannia (Evidence 1, 6, 8) and acknowledges his mutinous past (Evidence 6: 'I dared to mutiny...'). While Fletcher isn't explicitly named, the role of a first mate warning about instability aligns with Evidence 6 where Ayrton admits to character conflicts ('His character did not harmonize with mine... I dared to mutiny'). No evidence explicitly contradicts the berth's lucrative nature or Fletcher's role. Absence of Fletcher's name doesn't constitute contradiction since the narrative focuses on Ayrton's self-admitted instability.",success,100.9273772239685,5,31

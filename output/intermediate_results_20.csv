95,0,"Evidence 24 explicitly contradicts the backstory's claim that Villefort intended to denounce Noirtier. The passage states: 'Why, you poor short-sighted simpleton, can you not guess who this Noirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed? This Noirtier was his father!' followed by Villefort destroying the incriminating letter to protect Noirtier. This directly opposes the backstory's assertion of Villefort's intent to denounce his father, making the backstory impossible within the novel's established narrative.",success,26.07528066635132,5,25
136,0,"Evidence 8 (The Count of Monte Cristo) explicitly contradicts the backstory: Abbé Faria states 'I have been imprisoned since 1811' and describes drafting his treatise while incarcerated at Château d'If ('I wrote or studied... I had none but what I made for myself'). This directly conflicts with the backstory's claim of island residence from 1800 onward. Evidence 11 further confirms Faria created his work in prison using makeshift materials, with no mention of couriers or island setting.",success,105.97614812850952,5,28
59,1,"The evidence supports key elements of the backstory without explicit contradictions: 1) Multiple passages (Evidence 2, 10, 12, 15) confirm escapes from captivity and returns to mountainous terrain. 2) Rope-climbing survival skills are explicitly demonstrated (Evidence 1, 3, 5, 12, 18). 3) Avalanche awareness is contextually plausible (Evidence 16, 24, 27 describe avalanche events, though no 'reading' skill is directly shown). While the 'relay-station hand' detail isn't explicitly verified, its absence doesn't contradict the narrative. No evidence explicitly denies any claim, and moderate-strength passages align with the escape/survival framework.",success,15.433967113494873,5,27
60,1,"No explicit contradictory evidence found in the provided passages. The novel contains multiple avalanche events (Evidence 1, 4, 10, 14, 19, 21, 22) and depicts Thalcave as a heroic rescuer (Evidence 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 23), but none directly conflict with the specific 1852 silver-prospecting caravan rescue described in the backstory. While the French geographer in the novel is Paganel (Evidence 12, 16, 17), not Roux, this does not inherently contradict the existence of another geographer. The evidence strength is moderate but lacks explicit denial of the backstory's claims.",success,15.973235845565796,5,29
124,1,"No explicit contradiction found in the evidence. The backstory describes young Caderousse stealing a mooring rope in Marseille—a plausible act given his established character as dishonest (e.g., Evidence 30 shows him involved in shady dealings). While the specific event isn't directly supported, Evidence 1 and 4 reference Marseille quays and theft-related contexts without conflicting. Weak/irrelevant evidence (e.g., 'In Search of Castaways' excerpts) cannot contradict. Absence of explicit denial or timeline/logic conflict means the backstory remains consistent.",success,14.562088251113892,5,30
111,1,"The backstory describes a physically weakened character leveraging old connections to influence anti-royalist activities. Evidence 14-17 explicitly references Noirtier de Villefort—a paralyzed former Jacobin revolutionary—who maintains political influence through mental acuity and proxies. Evidence 14 states he 'condescends only to regard the young shoot' (influencing successors), Evidence 16 shows his nonverbal communication of continued capability ('I can still do much for you'), and Evidence 17 confirms his history as 'one of the most fiery Jacobins.' No evidence contradicts this portrayal; instead, the novel consistently depicts him orchestrating events despite physical limitations. Weak evidence thresholds don't apply here as moderate-strength passages directly support the claim.",success,12.611495971679688,5,31
135,1,"No explicit contradictions found in the evidence. The backstory describes events (1796-1800) not directly addressed in the provided novel excerpts. While evidence discusses later imprisonments (e.g., Abbé Faria's confinement from 1811 onward), it doesn't conflict with the claimed 1796 imprisonment. The evidence confirms prison writing occurs (e.g., Evidence 4,6,7) and escapes happen (e.g., Evidence 14,24), supporting the backstory's plausibility. Absence of evidence ≠ contradiction per analysis rules.",success,19.7390296459198,5,32
27,1,"No explicit contradictions found in the evidence. The backstory describes childhood events (running away at 12, dock work, hearing loss from a beating over charts) that are not addressed in any provided passages. Evidence snippets focus on adult characters' sea voyages, discoveries, and dialogues without mentioning childhood occupations, hearing impairments, or chart-related incidents. While evidence strength is moderate, it lacks relevance to the specific claims in the backstory. Absence of contradictory details supports consistency.",success,105.37894177436829,5,35
110,1,Evidence 2 and Evidence 7 explicitly show Villefort secluding himself in a locked study ('door locked and orders given that he should not be disturbed') while reflecting on past events ('began to ponder over the events... filled his mind with gloomy thoughts'). Evidence 16 further supports the presence of sensitive documents (the fatal Elba letter) in his possession. No evidence contradicts the claim of revolutionary pamphlets or private letters; the moderate-strength evidence aligns with the backstory's core elements without conflict.,success,99.57071948051453,5,32
42,1,"The evidence confirms Ayrton served as quartermaster on the Britannia (Evidence 1, 6, 8) and acknowledges his mutinous past (Evidence 6: 'I dared to mutiny...'). While Fletcher isn't explicitly named, the role of a first mate warning about instability aligns with Evidence 6 where Ayrton admits to character conflicts ('His character did not harmonize with mine... I dared to mutiny'). No evidence explicitly contradicts the berth's lucrative nature or Fletcher's role. Absence of Fletcher's name doesn't constitute contradiction since the narrative focuses on Ayrton's self-admitted instability.",success,100.9273772239685,5,31
56,1,"The backstory describes an earthquake prediction and credit given to 'the spirit of the plains.' Evidence 2, 8, 17, 19, and 22 explicitly reference earthquakes occurring (e.g., 'An earthquake!' cried Paganel, 'subterranean fires,' 'trembling of the ground'). While no evidence directly shows the specific actions of predicting, declining payment, or attributing credit, there is no contradictory evidence disproving these events. The absence of explicit confirmation does not constitute contradiction per the analysis rules. Moderate-strength evidence about earthquakes supports the plausibility of the backstory without conflicting with its claims.",success,19.550779819488525,4,27
80,1,"No explicit contradictions found in the evidence. The backstory describes events (learning tactics at 10, boar hunting achievement at 12, father's death by pirates, and warrior appointment) not addressed in the provided novel excerpts. Evidence 3/4/10/18 depict father-child relationships and combat training in different contexts (Ali Pasha/Haydée), but none conflict with the specific claims. Evidence 7/11/15/17/22/23/24/30 from 'In Search of the Castaways' show youthful training/achievements and parental loss, supporting narrative plausibility without direct contradiction. Absence of evidence ≠ contradiction per analysis rules.",success,17.81105065345764,5,30
28,1,"No explicit contradictions found in the evidence. The backstory describes events aboard the merchant ship 'Emerald Bird' not referenced in the provided novel excerpts. Evidence focuses on Ayrton's role as quartermaster of the Britannia (Evidence 7, 10, 23) and later interactions with Glenarvan's party, but does not address his pre-Britannia history. Claims about insurance fraud, false testimony, or 'legalised plunder' are neither confirmed nor denied in the text. Absence of evidence does not constitute contradiction per analysis rules.",success,12.51387071609497,5,27
101,0,"Evidence 17 explicitly contradicts the backstory. The novel states that Edmond Dantès (age 19) declared: 'I never had any [political] opinions... I am hardly nineteen... I know nothing.' This directly conflicts with the claim of joining a radical cell and speaking for revolutionary causes at age 18. The evidence (58% relevance) shows Dantès was apolitical at 19, making organized political activity at 18 impossible within the narrative timeline.",success,19.50072717666626,5,25
91,1,"The backstory describes Villefort working for Fouché, organizing assassinations of royalist deputies while posing as a Ministry official, and keeping arsenic. While the evidence shows Villefort as a royalist prosecutor investigating Bonapartist plots (Evidence 5, 8, 11), it does not explicitly contradict the backstory's claims. Evidence 2 hints at Villefort's hidden villainy ('this man with this spotless reputation was a villain'), and discussions of poison/arsenic (Evidence 12, 13, 16, 18) align with the backstory's theme of concealed crimes. No evidence explicitly denies the claimed double life or possession of arsenic, and the narrative allows for unrevealed aspects of Villefort's past. Absence of direct confirmation does not equal contradiction.",success,19.288252353668213,5,34
24,0,"The backstory claims the character served on 'Captain Grant’s new ship Brittany'. However, Evidence 8 explicitly states: 'I am really Tom Ayrton, quartermaster of the Britannia' and Evidence 10 confirms: 'Britannia, Captain Grant'. This directly contradicts the ship name 'Brittany' in the backstory. The consistent use of 'Britannia' across multiple evidence passages (8, 10, 11) constitutes strong explicit contradiction of a specific factual claim.",success,15.949745178222656,5,32
119,1,"The provided evidence contains no explicit contradictions to the backstory claims. While the novel passages detail Edmond Dantès' imprisonment at Château d'If and Abbé Faria's scholarly activities, they do not address or deny: (1) prior confinement at Fenestrella Fortress, (2) limestone engraving of 'On Ancient Mediterranean Routes', or (3) plagiarism by a warden. Absence of evidence is not contradiction. The backstory adds new details without conflicting with established events (e.g., Dantès' later intellectual development under Faria aligns with scholarly pursuits). Evidence strength is moderate but none explicitly refutes these claims.",success,201.9918713569641,5,27
93,0,"The backstory claims Fernand left copies of ciphered letters hidden in oak barrels in his vineyard, later unearthed by Villefort. However, Evidence 6 explicitly shows Villefort destroying the only incriminating letter (from the Island of Elba) and ensuring no copies exist: 'Have you shown this letter to anyone? [...] Everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the Island of Elba [...]? Everybody, except the person who gave it to me.' Villefort then destroys the letter and buries evidence of an unrelated crime (a child's body in Evidence 14), but there is no evidence of preserved ciphered letters or barrels. The backstory's specific details conflict with Villefort's systematic destruction of treason evidence in the novel.",success,115.72086334228516,5,33
72,1,"No explicit contradictory evidence found in the provided excerpts. The backstory describes training twelve English-speaking youths as spies in Auckland, with two infiltrating as servants to watch Glenarvan. While the novel mentions Auckland (Evidence 11: 'one was preparing to start for Auckland') and servants (Evidence 6: 'Ayrton remained unmoved, watching the coast'), it contains no references to spy networks, trained youths, or covert surveillance of Glenarvan. The absence of confirmation does not constitute contradiction, and no evidence explicitly denies the possibility of such events occurring off-page. The narrative remains unbroken as the backstory introduces no logical impossibilities (e.g., conflicting timelines or character traits) within the established context.",success,16.027915477752686,5,30
16,1,"The evidence contains no explicit contradictions to the backstory. While snippets reference Calcutta (Evidence 18-19, 23) and French/British connections (Evidence 3-6, 9), none directly conflict with the claim of being 'born in Calcutta to a British merchant family' with 'a French nurse' mother. The evidence mentioning Paris birth (Evidence 24) refers to Benedetto's backstory, not this character. Moderate-strength evidence cannot confirm the East India Company detail but shows no impossibility. Absence of confirmation ≠ contradiction per analysis rules.",success,18.544883489608765,4,24
